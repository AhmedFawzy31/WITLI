              <h2>Village R</h2>
              <p>
                In Jan 2009, the founders of Walk in the Light found themselves
                in the village of R for the first time. When they arrived they
                discovered the most amazing people who welcomed them and made
                them a part of their family! They also discovered what extreme
                poverty looked like. People walked five miles each way to a
                river to get dirty water. They had no roads, no electricity, no
                education, no healthcare and no hope of economic growth.
              </p>
              <p>
                After meeting with the village elders they said to the founders,
                “If you wash our back, we will wash our front.” This has paved
                the way for everything we do together. WITLI never does anything
                they can do themselves but helps in doing the things that are
                not possible. Today the community is a completely different
                place with a vibrant hope for a great future! In 8-10 years
                time, WITLI’s work in “R” will be complete. See how you can be a
                part of this transformation below.

                            Education truly is the key competent to a child’s
                            future, which is why a primary school was the first
                            step in the plan. This school now has grades 1-8,
                            and the next step is to finish a secondary school
                            with grades 9-12.

                            In the years directly after WITLI’s arrival in “R”,
                            the local church grew extensively, to the point
                            where a building expansion was needed! We partnered
                            with them to help build a new church building, and
                            completion is scheduled for the end of 2018!

                            over 200 patients in less than 30 days! After the
                            first week, patient flow was so great that an
                            additional nurse and midwife were hired to
                            accommodate the growing need! In the first year, the
                            “R” Health Center saw over 4000 patients.

                            blessed by generous donors to be able to start a
                            brand new garden at the school in Rialo where

              <h2>Village S</h2>
              <p>
                The terrain is very dry and flat. However, when you go there and
                meet the people, you experience life and energy! God led us to
                the village of S through Pastor Z who planted the first church
                in the community in 2009. He saw the first believer ever to come
                to know Christ in that village. Now there are five other church
                plants and hundreds of believers on fire! It was obvious God was
                up to something, and we just knew we had to be a part of that.
                The pastor has led the way in community conversations, which
                ultimately has created an amazing partnership between the
                community, the church and WITLI! Read below for more details.

                            Education truly is the key competent to a child’s
                            future, which is why a primary school was the first
                            step in the plan. This school now has grades 1-8,
                            and the next step is to finish a secondary school
                            with grades 9-12.

                            In the years directly after WITLI’s arrival in “R”,
                            the local church grew extensively, to the point
                            where a building expansion was needed! We partnered
                            with them to help build a new church building, and
                            completion is scheduled for the end of 2018!

                            over 200 patients in less than 30 days! After the
                            first week, patient flow was so great that an
                            additional nurse and midwife were hired to
                            accommodate the growing need! In the first year, the
                            “R” Health Center saw over 4000 patients.

              <p>
                The village of V heard about what WITLI was doing in R through
                family and asked us to come and meet with them in January 2013.
                They gave the team the greatest welcome we have ever
                experienced! The whole community celebrated us all day, then sat
                us down, thanked us for coming and shared their vision with us
                for their community and how we could help them achieve their
                dreams. Dreams to have clean water in their community, education
                for their children, health care for the sick, roads and bridges
                for economic and agricultural growth and so much more! Their
                initiative inspired us to not only believe in them but to
                believe that WITLI could grow to partner with them as well.
                Below you can read more about what has been accomplished so far
                and what else is ahead.

                          <p>
                            Education truly is the key competent to a child’s
                            future, which is why a primary school was the first
                            step in the plan. This school now has grades 1-8,
                            and the next step is to finish a secondary school
                            with grades 9-12.

                          <p>
                            In the years directly after WITLI’s arrival in “R”,
                            the local church grew extensively, to the point
                            where a building expansion was needed! We partnered
                            with them to help build a new church building, and
                            completion is scheduled for the end of 2018!

                            The “R” Health Center and Maternity Ward celebrated
                            it’s grand opening in January 2017 and tended to
                            over 200 patients in less than 30 days! After the
                            first week, patient flow was so great that an
                            additional nurse and midwife were hired to
                            accommodate the growing need! In the first year, the
                            “R” Health Center saw over 4000 patients.

                            to the best of their ability. In 2017, WITLI was
                            blessed by generous donors to be able to start a
                            brand new garden at the school in Rialo where
                            students will be trained in agricultural practices
                            so that they can contribute to the economy of their
                            village with this enhanced skill.
