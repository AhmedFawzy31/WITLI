          <h3>Co-Founder and President</h3>
          <p>
            After we got married, we met Daniel Ouedraogo from Burkina Faso. As
            he shared of his home and his story, it was hard to imagine such a
            place where the literacy rate was only 22%, where homes were made of
            clay without power or plumbing, and there was no access to health
            care. Feeling called by God to go and make a difference, Daniel
            invited us to go back home with him to his village. We had planned
            on going to Europe for our graduation trip, but instead felt
            compelled to visit Burkina Faso. While there, our eyes were opened
            to what extreme poverty really was. It broke our hearts. We knew we
            couldn’t just return home and do nothing.
          </p>
          <p>
            We asked the community what their greatest need was.They explained
            that their children had no access to education, and without
            education, their children had no future. They felt hopeless. So we
            decided to partner with the village elders to build a school in
            their village. They told us: we will wash our front if you wash our
            back. That meant they would do all they could if we would do what
            they could not.Being nineteen years old, and probably a little
            overzealous, we thought this would be a quick project, and then we
            would go on with life.
          </p>
          <p>
            We then created a 501c3 organization, opened a bank account, and
            formed a board. Thus, WITLI was created. It took two years to build
            the first three-classroom school in R. Once the school was built,
            instead of turning it over to the government, we felt like we needed
            to partner with the community and help them run it so it could
            become the best school possible. We quickly realized that this was
            so much more than one project! It became our life passion, something
            to which we have dedicated our entire lives!

          </p>
          <p>
            Through the school, we learned so much about the community and
            realized that without looking at the community as a whole and
            addressing all the issues, the chains of poverty would not be
            broken. For example, having the school is amazing; however, if kids
            are always dehydrated, malnourished, and severely sick, they do not
            excel. If their parents are barely surviving, and need their kids to
            work for them in the fields and gather water, then they can’t go to
            school. Over time, WILTI formed into a community development
            organization, tackling every angle of poverty to transform each
            village and the entire country of Burkina Faso. Our vision is to see
            healthy, sustainable communities that are thriving and producing the
            next generation of leaders!
